### Share your personal point of view.

Facts alone won't change minds, that's likely to just become an argument. People think in emotional stories. So, tell yours. 

Focus on how your agreed subject will impact you and your family & friends.

For example:

> **Less money for the NHS**
>
> ‘I worry that the NHS won't be there for me and my family with less money’
