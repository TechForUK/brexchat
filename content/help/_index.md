**Brexchat** is a simplified version of the Radical Conversation process created by psychiatrist and political scientist Dr Karin Tamerius.

We hope it will help you to have positive conversations rather than arguements.

The process has 5 steps:

1. Ask
2. Listen
3. Reflect
4. Agree
5. Share

Repeat
