Some people will never change their minds, so don’t try. But plenty of people will. Focus on them.

These 5 steps won’t necessarily happen in the order here and it may take many gentle conversations. You may have to think on your feet but remember - it’s not worth falling out over. 

Good luck & have a Happy Christmas.
