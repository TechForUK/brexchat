As members of the EU, the UK police force have access to the European Arrest Warrant system that enables the UK Police to access information about criminals from across all of Europe.

If the UK leaves the European Arrest Warrant system, some Police officers believe that criminals could try to hide in the UK, because they would be harder to find there.

The head of the National Crime Agency is "deeply concerned” about the security implications if the UK left without a deal.
