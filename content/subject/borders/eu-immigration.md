EU law states that people from the EU must either have a job (or enough money to not be a burden on the UK's public services) and have medical insurance to be allowed to come and live in the UK.

This is the law as defined by EEA Regulations Article 7:
1. All Union citizens shall have the right of residence on the territory of another Member State for a period of longer than three months if they:
(a) Are workers or self-employed persons in the host Member State; or
(b) Have sufficient resources for themselves and their family members not to become a burden on the social assistance system of the host Member State during their period of residence and have comprehensive sickness insurance cover in the host Member State

The UK can impose this EU law, if we want. But how many people from the EU do you think are coming to the UK and not contributing to society?
