title: The EU has free trade deals with over 70 countries
type: fact

Through our membership of the EU, the UK has around 40 free trade agreements with over 70 countries who are outside of the EU.

This is why fruits from Peru & South Africa are cheap for us to buy.

If we leave the EU, we will lose these free trade agreements and will have to start negotiating ourselves, we may not get as good a deal as the EU and these negotiations can take a long time - for example the EU's deal with Canada took 7 years to agree.

Do you think we will get a better trade deal with Japan as part of the EU or if we are on our own?
