Gertjan Vlieghe
Member of The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
"Analysis suggests that since the vote in June 2016, we have lost 2% of GDP relative to a scenario where there had been no significant domestic economic events. That amounts to around 40 billion pounds per year, or 800 million per week of lost income for the country as a whole."
