The Government estimates that the UK economy will be between 3.9% to 9.3% poorer over next 15 years if we go ahead with Brexit.

A loss of 3.9% a year would make the UK around Â£100 billion a year poorer by the 2030s.

The Government had to be forced into publishing these figures.

Imagine if we didn't have to do this. How would you like the government to spend the extra money we'd have from a stronger economy?
