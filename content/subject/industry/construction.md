There is a huge shortage of bricklayers, carpenters & plumbers in the UK. This shortage would be even worse without the 165,000 people from the EU currently working in UK construction.

This shortage means that wages in the construction industry keep going up to try to attract employees. Over 60% of small to medium sized construction companies expect to increase wages in the next 6 months.
