“As a member of the EU, we have free trade deals with over 50 countries outside of the EU from South Africa to South Korea. If we leave the EU, we will lose these agreements and will have to start negotiating ourselves too. This will take a long time - the EU’s deal with Canada took 7 years to agree."
