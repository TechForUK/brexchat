"The aim of the single market is to make trade between EU companies as easy as possible by making all members adopt the same standards.  This means that we know the beer produced in the UK, Germany or France are all of at least the same quality and so we donâ€™t need to check them when they come in or out. This keeps us all safe and makes it much easier to do business in Europe."
