The single market makes trade between EU companies easy by making all members keep to the same standards. 

This means that we know the toasters produced in the UK, Germany or France are all of at least the same quality and so we donâ€™t need to check them when they come in or out. This keeps us all safe and makes it much easier to do business in Europe.
