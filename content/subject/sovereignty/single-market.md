The Single Market simply makes trade between businesses inside the EU easy by having just one set of standards for everyone to use.

For example, we know the toasters produced in the UK, Germany or France meet the same safety checks so we don't need to inspect them when they are imported or exported. This keeps us all safe and makes it much easier and cheaper to do business in Europe.

And we can still make toasters of a higher standard if we want.
