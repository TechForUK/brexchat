title: The EU does not set UK taxes
type: fact
---

The EU does not have a direct role in raising taxes or setting tax rates, and has no say in how countries spend their tax revenues.

However, the EU does oversee some tax rules, e.g. minimum rates on VAT, taxes on petrol, tobacco and alcohol, which we already comply with. Any changes to these EU rules require unanimous approval, so the UK would effectively have a veto.
