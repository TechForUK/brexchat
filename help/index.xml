      <description> Ask open questions. If you ask someone to justify their views, they are likely to just become defensive and the conversation may become a battle with no winners.
Ask gentle, open questions about their hopes and emotions.
For example:
 &amp;lsquo;Can I ask what you hoped for?&amp;rsquo;

      <description>This is not about you being right and them being wrong. Try to understand their concerns and motivations. Ask more open questions.
If they have many concerns, focus on the biggest first.</description>

      <title>Reflect</title>

      <description> Show you understand. Repeat back what they have said to show that you have really heard what they have to say.
For example:
 ‘So, you are worried that the NHS is under too much pressure?’

      <description> Find common ground. This may not be easy at first but if you focus on their goals and emotions you will probably find something in common.
For example:
 ‘I agree, I&amp;rsquo;m really worried that in the future the NHS won&amp;rsquo;t be there for me and my family.’

      <description> Share your personal point of view. Facts alone won&amp;rsquo;t change minds, that&amp;rsquo;s likely to just become an argument. People think in emotional stories. So, tell yours.
Focus on how your agreed subject will impact you and your family &amp;amp; friends.
For example:
 Less money for the NHS
‘I worry that the NHS won&amp;rsquo;t be there for me and my family with less money’

      <title>We have the facts</title>

      <description>TalkAboutBrex has key facts at your fingertips, if you need it.
But remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not about being &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; or winning an argument.
Stopping Brexit is about protecting whose we care about. Try to think in stories and focus on how it will impact those you care about.</description>

      <description>Some people will never change their minds, so don’t try. But plenty of people will. Focus on them.
These 5 steps won’t necessarily happen in the order here and it may take many gentle conversations. You may have to think on your feet but remember - it’s not worth falling out over.
Good luck &amp;amp; have a Happy Christmas.</description>
