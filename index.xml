      <description> Ask open questions. If you ask someone to justify their views, they are likely to just become defensive and the conversation may become a battle with no winners.
Ask gentle, open questions about their hopes and emotions.
For example:
 &amp;lsquo;Can I ask what you hoped for?&amp;rsquo;

      <description>This is not about you being right and them being wrong. Try to understand their concerns and motivations. Ask more open questions.
If they have many concerns, focus on the biggest first.</description>

      <title>Reflect</title>

      <description> Show you understand. Repeat back what they have said to show that you have really heard what they have to say.
For example:
 ‘So, you are worried that the NHS is under too much pressure?’
 </description>

      <title>Agree</title>

      <description> Find common ground. This may not be easy at first but if you focus on their goals and emotions you will probably find something in common.
For example:
 ‘I agree, I&amp;rsquo;m really worried that in the future the NHS won&amp;rsquo;t be there for me and my family.’

      <description> Share your personal point of view. Facts alone won&amp;rsquo;t change minds, that&amp;rsquo;s likely to just become an argument. People think in emotional stories. So, tell yours.
Focus on how your agreed subject will impact you and your family &amp;amp; friends.
For example:
 Less money for the NHS
‘I worry that the NHS won&amp;rsquo;t be there for me and my family with less money’

      <description>TalkAboutBrex has key facts at your fingertips, if you need it.
But remember, it&amp;rsquo;s not about being &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; or winning an argument.
Stopping Brexit is about protecting whose we care about. Try to think in stories and focus on how it will impact those you care about.</description>

      <description>Some people will never change their minds, so don’t try. But plenty of people will. Focus on them.
These 5 steps won’t necessarily happen in the order here and it may take many gentle conversations. You may have to think on your feet but remember - it’s not worth falling out over.
Good luck &amp;amp; have a Happy Christmas.</description>

      <title>The single market is a good thing</title>

      <description>The single market makes trade between EU companies easy by making all members keep to the same standards.
This means that we know the toasters produced in the UK, Germany or France are all of at least the same quality and so we don’t need to check them when they come in or out. This keeps us all safe and makes it much easier to do business in Europe.</description>

      <description>Nearly all economists say we will be poorer after Brexit and so we are not going to get the extra £350 million a week for the NHS that we were promised.
Even Nigel Farage said he could not guarantee we would get that money.</description>

      <description>The UK has only lost a vote against a suggested EU law 56 out of 2536 times since 1999, so for around 98% of the time we agree with the EU.</description>

      <description>In really important areas like taxation, allowing another country to join the EU or citizen’s rights and justice, if the UK does not agree to an idea that has come from the EU, we can stop it the EU from doing it.</description>

      <description>As a member of the EU’s Single Market, we have free trade deals with all 27 EU countries. That is over 500 million customers. If we leave the Single Market, we will lose these agreements and will have to start negotiating with the EU again.</description>

      <description>As part of the EU, we have free trade deals with over 50 countries outside of the EU from South Africa to South Korea.
If we leave the EU, we will lose these agreements and will have to start negotiating ourselves, which can take a long time - the EU’s deal with Canada took 7 years to agree.</description>

      <description>In less important areas, if the European Council want to do something they take a vote and need at least 50% of the countries to agree to it.
So, while we’re in the EU, we get to discuss and debate and play a part in deciding what all the EU countries do.</description>

      <description>62,000 people from the EU currently work in the NHS.
But the NHS is still short of 35,000 nurses and nearly 10,000 doctors.
What would we do without the doctors and nurses from the EU?</description>
